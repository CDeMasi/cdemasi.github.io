Write up: The program fulfills all the features listed in the instruction pdf. I chose to do the one line scrabble board with the two blue double letter tiles. The program keeps track of
the user's current score and best score and updates the best score if the current is higher. If the user reloads the page, the program "forgets" they played at all and resets the scores 
to 0. The program also keeps track of how many tiles remain in the game. There is a restart button so that the user can start the game over with new tiles, as well as a submit word button 
that will check whether or not the word is valid. For bonus points, I added the dictionary file (words.txt). The program will check this file every time a user tries to submit a word
and makes sure that the word is valid. If it is not, an error alert displays.
